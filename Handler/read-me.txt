Build Steps
Load the Handler project and build as usual

Install Steps
- Create an application folder in IIS (/ssds-tasks/)
- Place the Handler.dll in /ssds-tasks/bin/
- Rename sample.Web.Config to Web.Config and place in /ssds-tasks/
- Modify Web.Config to use your own SSDS user/password and authority
- Be sure to create the "tasks" container before starting the project

Running the Server App
Once installed you should be able to browse to see the entity list here:
http://localhost/ssds-tasks/tasks.ssds

Any HTTP-aware command line tool (cUrl, wget, etc.) can be used to 
add, edit, delete entities. I use WFetch.exe for Windows.
