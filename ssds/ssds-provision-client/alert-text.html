<h3>Reminder</h3>
<p>
  Microsoft has posted 
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/dataservices/cc748807.aspx" title="SQL Server Data Services (SSDS) Maintenance Window Notification">an announcment</a>
  that SSDS will be upgraded between: Thursday, July 24, 2008 at 9:00 AM (PST)
  and Friday, July 25, 2008 at 9:00 AM (PST). <strong>This will likely result in an outage</strong>. <span class="urgent">All data will be deleted!</span>
</p>
<p>
  It is possible that, when Microsoft's SSDS servers come back up, the Provisioning Client will no longer function 
  properly. Also, the planned upgrade includes new features that the Provisioning Client will not support 
  right away. Once Microsoft completes the update, I will work to bring the Provisioning Client back online as soon 
  as possible. <span class="sig">(MikeA)</span>
